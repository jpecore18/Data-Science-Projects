Advice needed for a spineless pleb,"I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm an average or below guy, i get a match every now and then, but i blow my chances of getting anywhere because I'm too reserved / polite and I'm just not used to being risqué with pick up/ chat up lines.. 
Today a really pretty lass matched with me for some reason and i wanna say something, but i can't think of any other reason for people matching with me apart from looking for more insta followers - that's how insecure i am about my appearance.

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

But I’m open to discussion. How do you feel about it?","Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet) I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

"When you have a first date lined up, do you still keep texting with other people?","I'm asking about your personal experience with this decision. I'm not about to discuss what is right or wrong, I'm just curious. Obviously this applies to single people or people in open relationships.  


Personally I'm kinda torn. On one hand, I'm not committed to anyone at the moment, and I just want to spread the love and the good times. And there's the advantage of not being outcome dependent, when you have more interactions going.  
But then again, I feel the decision of texting with other people, while already having a first date set up, is somehow belittling the significance of the date and the person I'm meeting.

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

But I’m open to discussion. How do you feel about it?","Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet) I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

But I’m open to discussion. How do you feel about it?","Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet) I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

"When you have a first date lined up, do you still keep texting with other people?","I'm asking about your personal experience with this decision. I'm not about to discuss what is right or wrong, I'm just curious. Obviously this applies to single people or people in open relationships.  


Personally I'm kinda torn. On one hand, I'm not committed to anyone at the moment, and I just want to spread the love and the good times. And there's the advantage of not being outcome dependent, when you have more interactions going.  
But then again, I feel the decision of texting with other people, while already having a first date set up, is somehow belittling the significance of the date and the person I'm meeting.

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

But I’m open to discussion.

"When you have a first date lined up, do you still keep texting with other people?","I'm asking about your personal experience with this decision. I'm not about to discuss what is right or wrong, I'm just curious. Obviously this applies to single people or people in open relationships.  


Personally I'm kinda torn. On one hand, I'm not committed to anyone at the moment, and I just want to spread the love and the good times. And there's the advantage of not being outcome dependent, when you have more interactions going.  
But then again, I feel the decision of texting with other people, while already having a first date set up, is somehow belittling the significance of the date and the person I'm meeting. Do you ever get that?

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app.

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

But I’m open to discussion. How do you feel about it?","Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet) I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

"When you have a first date lined up, do you still keep texting with other people?","I'm asking about your personal experience with this decision. I'm not about to discuss what is right or wrong, I'm just curious. Obviously this applies to single people or people in open relationships.  


Personally I'm kinda torn. On one hand, I'm not committed to anyone at the moment, and I just want to spread the love and the good times. And there's the advantage of not being outcome dependent, when you have more interactions going.

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

Advice needed for a spineless pleb,"I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm an average or below guy, i get a match every now and then, but i blow my chances of getting anywhere because I'm too reserved / polite and I'm just not used to being risqué with pick up/ chat up lines.. 
Today a really pretty lass matched with me for some reason and i wanna say something, but i can't think of any other reason for people matching with me apart from looking for more insta followers - that's how insecure i am about my appearance. 
There is no bio to go off apart from that.

Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet),"I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

My elo score or whatever appears to be dogshit, and my photos do not do me justice, nor can I do a photo shoot anytime soon, so I just straight up don’t get shown to most girls. 

If I see someone cute who lives nearby, has a nice bio, and is obviously single what on earth is so bad about requesting to follow them on Instagram and sending them a message if they follow you back? They can just as easily ignore you- plus they get a better glimpse at you than on a dating app.

The last date I had was with a girl I never even matched with - I just found her on Instagram and sent her a message saying “hey I know this may not be the most romantic tale ever told but I just stumbled across you on tinder you stood out as being genuinely friendly and I appreciate your whacky taste in music, thought I’d have a stalk over here as you do then figured I’d message to ask blah blah”

It took me at least 20 minutes to find her but it was a great date and it never would’ve happened if I crossed my fingers and waited for some algorithm (bear in mind a ratio of 9:1 men to women) to make me visible then go through the usual tinder bullshit schtick. She said on the date that she was actually quite flattered by it. 

I’d be willing to bet half the guys who call it creepy are the same ones who send overly sexual messages from the get go and cause girls to delete the whole app. 
I’f you respect their boundaries and aren’t pushy I don’t see what’s wrong with this.

But I’m open to discussion. How do you feel about it?","Using Instagram to find and message people you haven’t matched with (yet) I understand it’s considered sacrilege to try to find and message someone from a dating app before even matching and getting their social media the usual way, and I used to believe that myself but hear me out...

"When you have a first date lined up, do you still keep texting with other people?","I'm asking about your personal experience with this decision. I'm not about to discuss what is right or wrong, I'm just curious. Obviously this applies to single people or people in open relationships.  


Personally I'm kinda torn. On one hand, I'm not committed to anyone at the moment, and I just want to spread the love and the good times. And there's the advantage of not being outcome dependent, when you have more interactions going.

I am a robust lady. Ityyy,"I'm a Robust Lady...

I'm not misshapen and I don't look like a sturdy sack of potatoes. I see a hate for fat people and I certainly don't want to waste my time. 

I carry my weight in my legs, breastickles, and stand pretty darn tall (5'7""). So fat to some. I'm a WIP but would never let a guy/gal believe I'm anything different. That's not something I get joy out of.

I hate being dishonest about my physical appearance whatsoever and fuck boys don't seem to care but I'm not with that. I don't like cum in my car. 

I'm educated, have a job, and have my own stability. Is it wrong to expect the same? 

Clearly my nerves have gotten the best of me. Plus leading folks on sucks.

I've never used an online dating service and I'm not sure if it's worth it for a robust lady even thought were fun and need love too.

I don't want to be fetishized. Just want to enjoy someone and see where It goes.","I am a robust lady. Ityyy I'm a Robust Lady...

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.","Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.","A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry.

"I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India?","I am 28, Indian girl. I am getting married to a man I love deeply in June 2021. I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married. Living in a conservative society like India, I never got to actually work on exploring my sexuality. I have been having sex with men since I was 18. But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere. Moreover, I am unable gather the courage to ask directly for sex to a woman. I do it with men, I have had plenty one night stands with men through tinder , but somehow it never worked out with a woman. What do I do?

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game. What did you have in mind?” She responded before I even had a chance to close the app “Why don’t you come over and we can figure it out. I’m at \_\_\_\_ Illif Rd.” My vision narrowed as I began the methodical process of getting ready to embark on a voyage of sickness.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4.

I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

My Tinder was randomly banned today?,"I've had Tinder for 2 years and use it every few months or so. I was sort of sending messages with this one girl and I went to check it just how and it's banned?

I'm thinking someone may have falsely reported me so I went ahead and emailed the support. Hopefully AI hear back soon.

Anyone else been randomly banned and not known why? My account was verified and everything.","My Tinder was randomly banned today? I've had Tinder for 2 years and use it every few months or so. I was sort of sending messages with this one girl and I went to check it just how and it's banned?

Matches that text you everyday after you give them your number.,"I will admit I’m a terrible texter, but one of my matches has texted me everyday this past week and added me on snap even though our convos suck. Bro, it’s quarantine. I have nothing to talk about and I’m not feeling this guy as much as I want to. Whenever I feel like this about a person I text them from TextNow and tell them I bought a new phone so they’re forced to get rid of my real phone number and then tell them I’m not interested. Works like a frickin charm lol","Matches that text you everyday after you give them your number.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup). 
He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder. I definitely gained some weight recently due to medications i had to take, but DAMN ! I’m not a bad looking girl at all and I’ve never had any kind of complaints in the looks department.

He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder. I definitely gained some weight recently due to medications i had to take, but DAMN ! I’m not a bad looking girl at all and I’ve never had any kind of complaints in the looks department.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with. 

I hate the modern dating world and I don't know how to go about it.","I hate the hookup culture... I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Need help,"Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other. So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

I matched with my next door neighbor,"So last night I matched with my next door neighbor. I've never met her in person, but I have seen her around the house and she has also seen me pottering about. She lives with two other girls in the house opposite me. It makes me wonder if she actually knows that I'm her neighbor. How should I approach this? What would be a great opening line?","I matched with my next door neighbor So last night I matched with my next door neighbor.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

\[*Paul Sorvino is an Italian-American actor, opera singer, businessman, writer, and sculptor. He often portrays authority figures on both sides of the law, and is known for his roles as Paulie Cicero in the 1990 gangster film Goodfellas, and NYPD Sergeant Phil Cerreta on the TV series Law &amp; Order.*\]

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend. Why does a guy feel the need to use Tinder if there already in a relationship? Should I stay, leave, tell his girlfriend? Opinions?","Tinder date has girlfriend in different country Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex.

When you're flirting with the guy you're dating on tinder and he doesn't know its you...,"I am in my 40s, never been on tinder before . Have been dating a guy for 2 months now, and he says how much he likes me and that since we've met he doesn't enter tinder. Then one day, I decide to open a tinder account, not with my real name, just as an anthropological experience, to see what this thing is about. A few swipes to the left, I suddenly come across the profile of the guy I am dating. Shocked. While I am contemplating if I should swipe him to the right or not, i have a network issue, my app crashes and Tinder restarts. His profile is gone. I feel relieved. Then I play swipe a bit longer,  and his profile comes up. AGAIN. The universe is telling me something. So I swipe him to the right. Not so many hours later we have a match. Conversation starts. I am devastated. The guys continues to declare he is not on tinder , but at the same time, he is texting me on my ""fake"" tinder, offering his phone number.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks. I suggested a video date for us to chat. She upped the anty and asked me out to meet at a local Coffee House then to head back to her place for dinner. I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.","Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.",1
"I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India?","I am 28, Indian girl. I am getting married to a man I love deeply in June 2021. I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married. Living in a conservative society like India, I never got to actually work on exploring my sexuality. I have been having sex with men since I was 18. But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere. Moreover, I am unable gather the courage to ask directly for sex to a woman. I do it with men, I have had plenty one night stands with men through tinder , but somehow it never worked out with a woman. What do I do? The desire is really strong and I HAVE to do this before I get married.","I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India? I am 28, Indian girl.

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Girl I met on tinder thought I was a catfish and blocked me,She was really cute and maybe I was too nice? Idk.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.",1
Need some advice,"I’m not on tinder for just hook ups or one stands with chicks. I actually wanna find a girl and meet her and maybe start a relationship or something among those lines. But I do get a decent amount of matches and everytime I try and open the convo I always fuck it up or she just stops messaging, or she just doesn’t msg me at all even though we match. Help?","Need some advice I’m not on tinder for just hook ups or one stands with chicks. I actually wanna find a girl and meet her and maybe start a relationship or something among those lines.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4. 
Professional.   We went to his place.  The kissing was outrageous.  He was amazing.
I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening.",1

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Thanks in advance!","Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month Hey guys,

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ? SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off.

Potential tinder date asked if I want to do coke when we meet up,"I've been talking to this girl on tinder who seemed rather normal. I asked if she wanted to hang out today, and she said she might be able to later tonight.

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

\[*Paul Sorvino is an Italian-American actor, opera singer, businessman, writer, and sculptor. He often portrays authority figures on both sides of the law, and is known for his roles as Paulie Cicero in the 1990 gangster film Goodfellas, and NYPD Sergeant Phil Cerreta on the TV series Law &amp; Order.*\]

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks. I suggested a video date for us to chat. She upped the anty and asked me out to meet at a local Coffee House then to head back to her place for dinner. I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.","A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry.

I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married.

But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere.

I do it with men, I have had plenty one night stands with men through tinder , but somehow it never worked out with a woman. What do I do?

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint.

I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust.

Wrong swipe on Tinder,,Wrong swipe on Tinder ,1
The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!",1
I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could... But man, that was gross!","My three dates with an IT nerd I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree.

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4.

I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup). 
He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder. I definitely gained some weight recently due to medications i had to take, but DAMN ! I’m not a bad looking girl at all and I’ve never had any kind of complaints in the looks department. This was absolutely wild !! He’s 28 by the way.","LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Need help,"Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other. So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

I matched with my next door neighbor,"So last night I matched with my next door neighbor. I've never met her in person, but I have seen her around the house and she has also seen me pottering about. She lives with two other girls in the house opposite me. It makes me wonder if she actually knows that I'm her neighbor. How should I approach this? What would be a great opening line?","I matched with my next door neighbor So last night I matched with my next door neighbor.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy.

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.",1
Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend. Why does a guy feel the need to use Tinder if there already in a relationship? Should I stay, leave, tell his girlfriend?

When you're flirting with the guy you're dating on tinder and he doesn't know its you...,"I am in my 40s, never been on tinder before . Have been dating a guy for 2 months now, and he says how much he likes me and that since we've met he doesn't enter tinder. Then one day, I decide to open a tinder account, not with my real name, just as an anthropological experience, to see what this thing is about. A few swipes to the left, I suddenly come across the profile of the guy I am dating. Shocked. While I am contemplating if I should swipe him to the right or not, i have a network issue, my app crashes and Tinder restarts. His profile is gone. I feel relieved. Then I play swipe a bit longer,  and his profile comes up. AGAIN. The universe is telling me something. So I swipe him to the right. Not so many hours later we have a match. Conversation starts. I am devastated. The guys continues to declare he is not on tinder , but at the same time, he is texting me on my ""fake"" tinder, offering his phone number.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks. I suggested a video date for us to chat. She upped the anty and asked me out to meet at a local Coffee House then to head back to her place for dinner. I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.","Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going.

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone.

I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Girl I met on tinder thought I was a catfish and blocked me,She was really cute and maybe I was too nice? Idk. But she kept asking for different pictures of my surroundings and she said she never acts like this. After trying to prove that I’m not a catfish over and and she blocked me. Kinda weird.

Is tinder really a hookup app as everyone says?,"I was told by so many of my friends (both genders) that tinder is a HOOKUP app, so I decided to join in on the fun. I had a lot of matches the first couple days, and after having a couple conversations, I realized that most of these girls are saying ""I don't do hookups"" or ""I'm kinda looking for something serious"". 

I've yet to meet a girl who is DTF. Is tinder really a hookup app, or am I just having the worst of luck?","Is tinder really a hookup app as everyone says?

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game. What did you have in mind?” She responded before I even had a chance to close the app “Why don’t you come over and we can figure it out. I’m at \_\_\_\_ Illif Rd.” My vision narrowed as I began the methodical process of getting ready to embark on a voyage of sickness. I hit the bong twice more, gathered my keys, changed into non-descript clothing, and slipped my shoes on.**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessions Pt. 4  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4. 
Professional.   We went to his place.  The kissing was outrageous.  He was amazing.
I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Whenever I feel like this about a person I text them from TextNow and tell them I bought a new phone so they’re forced to get rid of my real phone number and then tell them I’m not interested.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

Tinder Thots Tuesday: Long Gone Summer,,Tinder Thots Tuesday: Long Gone Summer ,1
Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time.

As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Thanks in advance!","Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month Hey guys,

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

THIS GUY I KNEW ON TINDER BACK IN JUNE ACTUALLY HAS A WIFE WHO WAS PREGNANT WITH HIS FIRST CHILD,"I didn’t know he was married AT ALL. No wedding pictures whatsoever. I thought he was annoying because he kept sending me good morning texts and asks for selfies. So I just ghosted him for a while but we’re still following each other on instagram. Today, he posted a pic of him with his newborn!!!! His wife just gave birth yesterday. LMAO. So he was fuckin around on Tinder while his wife is carrying his first child?!! 😭😭 lmaooo I know this probably happens a lot but never thought it would happen to me.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup). 
He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder. I definitely gained some weight recently due to medications i had to take, but DAMN ! I’m not a bad looking girl at all and I’ve never had any kind of complaints in the looks department. This was absolutely wild !! He’s 28 by the way.","LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with. 

I hate the modern dating world and I don't know how to go about it.","I hate the hookup culture... I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...",1
Potential tinder date asked if I want to do coke when we meet up,"I've been talking to this girl on tinder who seemed rather normal. I asked if she wanted to hang out today, and she said she might be able to later tonight.

Then said she has some coke if I'm interested that (It was a snow flake emoji so either coke or meth idk)

I obviously don't want to do drugs.

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Need help,"Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other. So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

\[*Paul Sorvino is an Italian-American actor, opera singer, businessman, writer, and sculptor. He often portrays authority figures on both sides of the law, and is known for his roles as Paulie Cicero in the 1990 gangster film Goodfellas, and NYPD Sergeant Phil Cerreta on the TV series Law &amp; Order.*\]

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

\[*Paul Sorvino is an Italian-American actor, opera singer, businessman, writer, and sculptor. He often portrays authority figures on both sides of the law, and is known for his roles as Paulie Cicero in the 1990 gangster film Goodfellas, and NYPD Sergeant Phil Cerreta on the TV series Law &amp; Order.*\]

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend. Why does a guy feel the need to use Tinder if there already in a relationship? Should I stay, leave, tell his girlfriend?

While I am contemplating if I should swipe him to the right or not, i have a network issue, my app crashes and Tinder restarts. His profile is gone. I feel relieved. Then I play swipe a bit longer,  and his profile comes up. AGAIN. The universe is telling me something. So I swipe him to the right. Not so many hours later we have a match. Conversation starts.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks.

I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing.

What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.","A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry.

"I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India?","I am 28, Indian girl. I am getting married to a man I love deeply in June 2021. I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married.

But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere.

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game. What did you have in mind?” She responded before I even had a chance to close the app “Why don’t you come over and we can figure it out.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could... But man, that was gross!","My three dates with an IT nerd I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”.

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4. 
Professional.   We went to his place.  The kissing was outrageous.  He was amazing.
I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening.","A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings) So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Thanks in advance!","Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month Hey guys,

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup). 
He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder. I definitely gained some weight recently due to medications i had to take, but DAMN ! I’m not a bad looking girl at all and I’ve never had any kind of complaints in the looks department.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you?

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.

* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words.

Any questions, lemme know.

\-Andy","How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

Potential tinder date asked if I want to do coke when we meet up,"I've been talking to this girl on tinder who seemed rather normal. I asked if she wanted to hang out today, and she said she might be able to later tonight.

Then said she has some coke if I'm interested that (It was a snow flake emoji so either coke or meth idk)

I obviously don't want to do drugs.

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.",1
My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival.

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy.

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend.

I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out.

When you're flirting with the guy you're dating on tinder and he doesn't know its you...,"I am in my 40s, never been on tinder before . Have been dating a guy for 2 months now, and he says how much he likes me and that since we've met he doesn't enter tinder.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks. I suggested a video date for us to chat. She upped the anty and asked me out to meet at a local Coffee House then to head back to her place for dinner. I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.","Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder.

As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game. What did you have in mind?” She responded before I even had a chance to close the app “Why don’t you come over and we can figure it out.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol",1
I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4. 
Professional.   We went to his place.  The kissing was outrageous.  He was amazing.
I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Whenever I feel like this about a person I text them from TextNow and tell them I bought a new phone so they’re forced to get rid of my real phone number and then tell them I’m not interested.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours.

THIS GUY I KNEW ON TINDER BACK IN JUNE ACTUALLY HAS A WIFE WHO WAS PREGNANT WITH HIS FIRST CHILD,"I didn’t know he was married AT ALL. No wedding pictures whatsoever. I thought he was annoying because he kept sending me good morning texts and asks for selfies. So I just ghosted him for a while but we’re still following each other on instagram. Today, he posted a pic of him with his newborn!!!! His wife just gave birth yesterday. LMAO. So he was fuckin around on Tinder while his wife is carrying his first child?!! 😭😭 lmaooo I know this probably happens a lot but never thought it would happen to me.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup). 
He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder. I definitely gained some weight recently due to medications i had to take, but DAMN ! I’m not a bad looking girl at all and I’ve never had any kind of complaints in the looks department. This was absolutely wild !! He’s 28 by the way.","LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with. 

I hate the modern dating world and I don't know how to go about it.","I hate the hookup culture... I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

Need advice.,"Im hoping someone can help with this question. Is the location accurate on Tinder? Meaning in miles away ? A person close to me met a guy and went out a couple of times . They are about 25 miles away, according to each profile.  Well it has changed today to 65 miles, but the guy was supposedly going away on business out of state  but where he was going is well over 65 miles. I think hes lying.","Need advice.

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Need help,"Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other. So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅",1

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks. I suggested a video date for us to chat. She upped the anty and asked me out to meet at a local Coffee House then to head back to her place for dinner. I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.","Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.","A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date.

"I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India?","I am 28, Indian girl. I am getting married to a man I love deeply in June 2021. I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married. Living in a conservative society like India, I never got to actually work on exploring my sexuality. I have been having sex with men since I was 18. But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere.

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game. What did you have in mind?” She responded before I even had a chance to close the app “Why don’t you come over and we can figure it out.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

Need some advice,"I’m not on tinder for just hook ups or one stands with chicks. I actually wanna find a girl and meet her and maybe start a relationship or something among those lines. But I do get a decent amount of matches and everytime I try and open the convo I always fuck it up or she just stops messaging, or she just doesn’t msg me at all even though we match.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4. 
Professional.   We went to his place.  The kissing was outrageous.  He was amazing.
I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Whenever I feel like this about a person I text them from TextNow and tell them I bought a new phone so they’re forced to get rid of my real phone number and then tell them I’m not interested.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening.","A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings) So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Thanks in advance!","Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month Hey guys,

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information).

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ? SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster.

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful.

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival.

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy.

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks.

I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up.

The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.",1

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.","A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry.

"I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India?","I am 28, Indian girl. I am getting married to a man I love deeply in June 2021. I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married.

But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere.

I do it with men, I have had plenty one night stands with men through tinder , but somehow it never worked out with a woman. What do I do?

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone.

She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4.

I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅",1

My Tinder was randomly banned today?,"I've had Tinder for 2 years and use it every few months or so. I was sort of sending messages with this one girl and I went to check it just how and it's banned?

I'm thinking someone may have falsely reported me so I went ahead and emailed the support. Hopefully AI hear back soon.

Anyone else been randomly banned and not known why? My account was verified and everything.","My Tinder was randomly banned today? I've had Tinder for 2 years and use it every few months or so. I was sort of sending messages with this one girl and I went to check it just how and it's banned?

Matches that text you everyday after you give them your number.,"I will admit I’m a terrible texter, but one of my matches has texted me everyday this past week and added me on snap even though our convos suck. Bro, it’s quarantine. I have nothing to talk about and I’m not feeling this guy as much as I want to. Whenever I feel like this about a person I text them from TextNow and tell them I bought a new phone so they’re forced to get rid of my real phone number and then tell them I’m not interested. Works like a frickin charm lol","Matches that text you everyday after you give them your number.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup). 
He gets out of his Audi takes ONE look at me from the street (I’m in the dark standing under the porch), says “no thanks” turns around, leaves without another word and immediately unmatched me on tinder.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with. 

I hate the modern dating world and I don't know how to go about it.","I hate the hookup culture... I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Need help,"Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other. So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off.

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting?

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend. Why does a guy feel the need to use Tinder if there already in a relationship? Should I stay, leave, tell his girlfriend?

When you're flirting with the guy you're dating on tinder and he doesn't know its you...,"I am in my 40s, never been on tinder before . Have been dating a guy for 2 months now, and he says how much he likes me and that since we've met he doesn't enter tinder. Then one day, I decide to open a tinder account, not with my real name, just as an anthropological experience, to see what this thing is about. A few swipes to the left, I suddenly come across the profile of the guy I am dating. Shocked. While I am contemplating if I should swipe him to the right or not, i have a network issue, my app crashes and Tinder restarts. His profile is gone. I feel relieved. Then I play swipe a bit longer,  and his profile comes up. AGAIN. The universe is telling me something. So I swipe him to the right. Not so many hours later we have a match. Conversation starts. I am devastated. The guys continues to declare he is not on tinder , but at the same time, he is texting me on my ""fake"" tinder, offering his phone number. What would you do?","When you're flirting with the guy you're dating on tinder and he doesn't know its you... I am in my 40s, never been on tinder before .

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match,"I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online. From the start she was very aggressive and very complimentary about my looks. I suggested a video date for us to chat. She upped the anty and asked me out to meet at a local Coffee House then to head back to her place for dinner. I was really hesitant to do this and have never really felt comfortable going over to a strangers house on a first date. But I thought Id just go the the coffee place and scout things out. I arrived at 5 and waited till 530 before it was clear I was being stood up. Then they unmatched me. The weird thing was literally no one drove past, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a look and not liking the goods. lol. I just find it so strange to be asked out then stood up. I mean if I did the asking out, I would understand, but she/he/they were so aggressive.","Weird Non-Sense Standup from Aggressive Tinder Match I matched with a woman in my area and we chatted a bit online.

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going.

Living in a conservative society like India, I never got to actually work on exploring my sexuality. I have been having sex with men since I was 18. But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere. Moreover, I am unable gather the courage to ask directly for sex to a woman. I do it with men, I have had plenty one night stands with men through tinder , but somehow it never worked out with a woman. What do I do? The desire is really strong and I HAVE to do this before I get married.","I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India? I am 28, Indian girl.

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Tl;dr found girl by a very small chance, do I tell her?","Do I tell her?

Girl I met on tinder thought I was a catfish and blocked me,She was really cute and maybe I was too nice? Idk. But she kept asking for different pictures of my surroundings and she said she never acts like this. After trying to prove that I’m not a catfish over and and she blocked me. Kinda weird.

Is tinder really a hookup app as everyone says?,"I was told by so many of my friends (both genders) that tinder is a HOOKUP app, so I decided to join in on the fun.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game. What did you have in mind?” She responded before I even had a chance to close the app “Why don’t you come over and we can figure it out. I’m at \_\_\_\_ Illif Rd.” My vision narrowed as I began the methodical process of getting ready to embark on a voyage of sickness. I hit the bong twice more, gathered my keys, changed into non-descript clothing, and slipped my shoes on.**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessions Pt. 4  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name.

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could...

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.",1
Need some advice,"I’m not on tinder for just hook ups or one stands with chicks. I actually wanna find a girl and meet her and maybe start a relationship or something among those lines. But I do get a decent amount of matches and everytime I try and open the convo I always fuck it up or she just stops messaging, or she just doesn’t msg me at all even though we match. Help?","Need some advice I’m not on tinder for just hook ups or one stands with chicks. I actually wanna find a girl and meet her and maybe start a relationship or something among those lines.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4. 
Professional.   We went to his place.  The kissing was outrageous.  He was amazing.
I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

Tell me what a bad person I am. But shit.  He repeatedly told me he was honest and responsive.  I was like *ok*... I believe you.","I did something... and got my karma I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening. The rest of the day was a blur at work as I waffled between flaking or rescheduling. But, true to my core, I stood firm ready to face the music. Around 7:30pm that evening, I was cleaning my smoking apparatus when I got a message notification. “Hey, I’m almost there. We still on?” The moment of truth. I took a massive rip from The Green Goblin and responded “Yes ma’am we are.”**   [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/5/6/tinder-confessionals-pt-1)","Tinder Confessional Pt. 1  **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening.",1

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Thanks in advance!","Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month Hey guys,

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

I hate the hookup culture...,"I feel like I'm the only one who's really opposed to the hookup culture as a 21 year old. I've had 4 girlfriends and those are the only girls I've slept with. When I'm single, I don't try to hookup with girls, unless we start dating.

What kind of guy would want to have sex with a girl who is actively sleeping around with other guys? Why would any guy want to sleep around with a girl who had a huge body count because of hookups, before she's ready to ""settle down"" with you? 

Every time I'm using tinder or any dating app, the girls I talk to keep me as just an option, and they have dozens of other guys to date/hookup with.

Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder?,"He friends
I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...",1

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

Best wishes &amp; stay safe ya'll.","Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder  So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in.

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend.

Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion,"
I matched with this girl. We started talking, and in her profile it talked about how she would sell her soul for a  spongebob toaster(like one of those that burns the picture into the toast.) Below is the basics of what occurred:

Me: I went on amazon to see how much a spongebob toaster costs, and its 40 bucks! Kinda cheap for your soul.

Her: No way thats wayy to much money

Me: What if I got you one of the spongebob popsicles that those creepy old icecream trucks sell?

Her: As long as you are the creepy old man I will definitely eat your popsicle 

Me: Ok deal then pulling up in my creepy ice cream truck soon

Me: Its a deal then your soul for my popsicle

Then she unadded me. Now I know it was moving wayyy to fast but thought wow maybe its one of those reddit moments.

Was I just too surprised at the action and misread that? I feel bad because I don’t normally say stuff like that but thought thats what she was insinuating. What would you guys have done?","Am I Socially Inept- Looking for your opinion

A Story But Also Seeking Advice??,"If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

I met a cute guy on Tinder, well not in person, yet. But we matched two days ago and talked for hours on the app, we really clicked! I wanna put his picture on here just to show y’all how shocked I am he even matched with me, but one of the things we related on was always being on Reddit for memes, drama, and porn. (It is what it is 🤷🏾‍♀️) He was funny and smart and gave me a cute nickname which I didn’t mind at all. Eventually the app started being weird and double sending our messages or not sending them at all, so I gave him my number, he asked for my Snapchat as well, which I didn’t have so I gave him my Instagram. We eventually got tired of texting and we started talking on the phone for a while. He realized finally what time it was and that he hadn’t gone to get groceries with his brother/roommate like planned to that day, so he left to go run that errand and said he’d call me back later. In the mean time he asked if I’d make him a playlist of some of my favorite songs since we both bonded over singing and playing guitar. He shared with me a poem that he’s trying to turn into a song and I told him how I liked it and related to it and how I had interpreted it, to which he agreed I hit the themes on the nail. He asked if I’d help him figure out a melody for it and so we would make plans for lunch and watching anime this weekend, and all of the above when he’d get back. 

I haven’t heard from him and it’s been two days. (Now bare with me)


I normally don’t get sad or discouraged over these things because it’s Tinder, this shit happens...but he was really nice. I’m sure he’s busy and I’m just overreacting cause the only real interaction I get is with my professors over zoom, but my doubts start to kick in. What is a cute guy like that (who some how is so introverted) even want with you anyhow? He’s probably not even into you, or he just wants to sleep with you and you’re being stupid as per usual. I am just kind of disappointed did I do something wrong? He hasn’t blocked my Instagram or unmatched so I’m unsure. 


I mean for fucks sake it was nice to just match with a guy that didn’t have some weird fetish for black girls and could just have normal conversation with me.","A Story But Also Seeking Advice?? If this isn’t suited for this subreddit deleting it is fine, I understand.

"I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife","My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder. (I had been out of an extremely abusive relationship for about 9 months at this point) 

I thought about it for a while then said sure and I downloaded it. I set my profile the way I wanted and started swiping, we were both looking through each other's phones and this girl came up on my friends page, I told her to swipe left because I wanted that girl and kept swiping to see if she would pop up. 

About 15 minutes later that girl popped up, i was so excited I swiped right, then it was an immediate match. I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said yes.

We went to this little café that I love, then to the river, then to lunch, then to a park. Our first kiss was on the play equipment. Our first date lasted 7 and a half hours. It was amazing. 

We fast tracked a few things but im so glad we did, now we live together, both of our families loves the other and we are engaged. I love this person, so much. I never thought I would find what I have on Tinder, but Im so glad my friend convinced me.","I got on Tinder because my best friend and I were bored, and then I met my soon to be wife My best friend and I were at my place and we were just relaxing and joking around, then she asked me if I would be willing to get Tinder.

A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used. What should I do?,"So 2 days ago I met a girl on tinder and in the following day we met for a date. After 7 hours drinking beer and talking we decided to leave. Everything seemed perfect and there was a chemistry between us. Since it was already quite late I took her home. When we were going to say goodbye and kiss in the face to each other we suddenly kisses each other for a while. At this moment I felt none of us wanted to leave so she invited me to go upstairs to her flat. So I did. OK so fast forward We had ""sex"" even though I told her I had no condoms with me since I was not expecting that it would go too much fast. During the act I asked her what would happen next and she told me that it depend on me and her. I also told her why was it going too fast and she said because she enjoyed me. She was clearly more experient than me and she was a hell of a girl doing everything and in an experient way and after the act she took a shower and I felt I was not desired anymore. Next day I sent her a message saying good day and I got blocked on insta and unmatch on tinder, which makes me feel so sad and used at the same time. Maybe she was just drunk and she wanted just fun. The problem here is that I really liked her and I did want more than just casual stuff. I still have acces to her facebook. Should I ask her a justification or just move on? I prefer when someone is direct saying she didn't enjoy me after all and tell me all my imperfections rather than blocking without saying anything","A girl I met on Tinder just blocked me with no reason after sex in the first date and now I'm feeling somehow used.

A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story,"On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry. 

I didn’t think he was that cute, honestly, and I just swiped because I didn’t want to miss out on any potential matches (I thought I wasn’t going to get any matches; I was wrong). I don’t remember any of the things he said or what I said. I looked later on to see what we’d said but the messages were gone. We didn’t talk much, other than exchanging snapchats. 

I proceeded to get a few more matches, and I bought Tinder gold. I felt like it was misleading because I thought I was paying $6.70 a month for it, not $80 all at once. I was annoyed, and wanted to make the best of it. I spent a LOT of time on tinder, as it was summer and I didn’t have anything better to do. I had been in a mental hospital after a horrible breakup with an immature high school boyfriend. Over the course of 3 months I accumulated about 1000 matches, about 300 of whom I had conversations with. I lost count of the number of “likes” I got from tinder gold. I went on dates with maybe 30 different guys, only kissing 3 and sleeping with none (well one eventually). 

I had some hilariously awful experiences. I had a coffee date with a guy who said he was 19, then was 45 minutes late to our date because his mom got to drunk to drive him. Turns out he was a 16-year old sophomore in high school. Another date it was just me and a guy in a screening of “Midsommar” and a guy came in and started making creepy noises, so I ran out the emergency exit to get security because I thought he was going to shoot us. Once, I showed up at a guy’s address only to find out it was a gardening shop he worked at and he wanted me to have lunch in the break room with him. He then bought me a small cactus. 

My future partner, “Patrick” snapped me a few times and I avoided talking to him. I had a few conversations on Tinder with him but they didn’t go anywhere. Then, one night, I was invited by a different guy, a cool frat guy to go to an alien-themed party at a hotel. It started at 10, though, and I had some time to kill. So when Patrick wanted to get coffee with me, I said sure. I got there, it was awkward, mainly because it was his 20th birthday that day and he chose to go out with me for his very first Tinder date. I didn’t think he was stunningly hot or even very interesting. We didn’t have much chemistry and the date only lasted about an hour and a half. I was dressed to go to a party, and I didn’t think his first impression of me was very striking either. But he texted me again, and we went out again, and a few more times, because I was lonely, and he was lonely, and he waited until the 5th date to kiss me, and then immediately asked if I wanted to have sex, and I laughed and said no and it was painfully awkward and a few dates later we were exclusive, and then I was his girlfriend, and soon enough I met his parents and he told me he loved me and I stayed over at his house and he made me a promise ring from a chunk of brass he got at a hardware store.

Over a year later, Patrick and I moved away from our hometown and live together now. We have so many exciting things planned for our lives and it started with two swipes on Tinder...he went on one date and I went on 30+. Lucky for us, we were persistent, even though we didn’t know at the time why we cared so much to keep a casual relationship going. It just happened that way.","A Tumultuous Tinder Success Story On the first day of using tinder, when I was horribly depressed and had just turned 18, I matched with the man I am going to marry.

"I want to explore my bisexuality before I get married, which is soon. How to do it in India?","I am 28, Indian girl. I am getting married to a man I love deeply in June 2021. I am very happy with my life right now. It is just that there are these things that I would never get to do once I'm married. Living in a conservative society like India, I never got to actually work on exploring my sexuality. I have been having sex with men since I was 18. But never had a chance to do anything with a girl, which I really really want to. I believe I'm bisexual, as I get attracted to men and women alike. Yet that part of me which is attracted to girls never got its due. And it bothers me a lot.  I really really want to do it at least once with a woman. So much that I have dreams about it when I sleep.  I tried talking to a few girls on tinder, but the conversation went nowhere. Moreover, I am unable gather the courage to ask directly for sex to a woman. I do it with men, I have had plenty one night stands with men through tinder , but somehow it never worked out with a woman. What do I do?

Do I tell her?,"So I was on a different dating app (POF) swiping through as you do, when suddenly I got a bit upset and annoyed at my self thinking, I'm never going to find anyone. So I close that and open tinder and I just used up all my right swipes then closed it. About 10 minutes later I get a match. I'm thinking ohh ok cool, so I go check her out looks good, really good, only 6 or so words in her bio. As you do I messaged her something. Honestly, best opening I've ever done it was original, funny something to do with one of her pictures. This was around 6:30pm. We hit it off right away, talking till 4 in the morning. She seems to really like me and I like her. The question is, Do I tell her she was a Match because I was bored and annoyed? I really don't think she would have swiped right if I didn't. I really don't know if she would find it funny.

Tinder Confessions Pt. 4," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?” I smiled so broadly that I caught my own reflection in my phone screen. I clapped back “I’m game.

The Foodie,"One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

He was midly witty with sweet and polite undertones in the way he carried out the conversations. He’s also a foodie and cooked a lot, so he sent me pics of his dishes. He’s also very good with arranging food and taking pictures, so i really enjoyed chatting with him since i had been very much into food porn at the time.

He said he liked strong woman and would be happy to be in a submissive role and treating his woman like a queen. I got cheeky and asked if the queen needed a whip to discipline him if he misbehaved. He suggested that i should get a riding crop, a collar and a leash as well! I am a strong-willed woman but believes in equal relationship, but I joked along that I could learn to become a Dominatrix!

The next morning he texted me saying he had ordered a latex shirt, a pair of latex leggings and a pair of latex shorts that night! I had no ideas what these were, so I googled them and found out they cost from $200-300 each! I was flabbergasted, but didn’t want to ruin the fun. Although there were sexual connotations, the conversation was still very polite and sweet. He asked if we could meet the following week, and i said ok. 

That evening he asked if we could do a video chat through skype, so I agreed. In my mind I thought this guy was as cute as button, and pictured that he would have a flat tummy and killer smiles since he had the confidence to wear latex clothes. I felt a little insecure before turning on skype, because i was in pyjamas sans make-up, and he’s a couple of years younger than i.

Skype was on! What i saw was a fat and bald version of Peter Jacobson with Sean Hayes’ mannerisms! I tried to keep my cool and polite composure and carried on the conversation like i saw the same guy in the pictures! 

The next day he texted me that he started a diet regimen of low carbs and low calories! We continued our conversations in cordial manners. I did not mention about the difference of his picture and how he looked in reality, nor did I mention about the upcoming meeting at all. He continued to send me pics of his diet and reported his weight loss. Apparently he lost 3lbs each day and sent me pics of his scale indications each day. All I texted back was “wow, good job!”, and continued like that for a couple of weeks before I stopped checking my skype messages.

I hope he finally came to the sense of self-esteem and self respect!","The Foodie One upon a time in a galaxy far away called Tinder, i swiped right a profile with a picture of a guy who looked like Michael Buble and we matched! He texted right away, so we started chatting.

I've been scammed and I don't even know why,"I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???","I've been scammed and I don't even know why I just found out yesterday that the guy I've been seeing gave me a fake name and last name. 
I know there are a lot of aholes out there but I don't know why he played me . I found out because he accidentally sent me a picture of himself in his military uniform with a different last name. I followed up and found him on Facebook even though he had said in the past that he doesn't have social media cause he has a complicated relationship with his parents. His profile is all weird too, his only Friends being some random ass women from all over the world with 1500 friends.

I called him and asked him wtf and he denied lying, and it being him and all. Even though his profile picture is literally of his face so unless he has an evil twin then....


I made it clear when we started talking that I only wanted a casual FWB thing. The moment we met up he (I suppose now acted) behaved as if he really did like me. I was gonna do him anyways so I don't even know why he would lie to me. We talked every day all day long and I developed feelings for him and it's really been a long time since I've cared about someone.

He didn't contact me after our conversation yesterday so I Guess it was Just a sick game to him but I still can't understand why he would do this since we would have f*** anyway and I didn't want anything serious. Isn't that an ideal relationship for a guy???",1

My three dates with an IT nerd,"I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree. Most were pleasant, and i dated two cute guys - each for three months. I actually fell in love with a cultured one in Vancouver (Canada), but he has three kids under 18 so it was tough and I broke off (perhaps the only relationship I regretted to have given up). Then I dated another cute guy in Bellingham during covid, and it didn’t work out due to border lockdown and personality differences.

Anyhow, the weird experience i had was with an IT guy  who’s 6’3” and bald. We met and spent two hours walking and talking, and he seemed reasonably decent and reliable. At the end he kissed me and i went with the flow to see if there’s any chemistry. I didn’t feel anything, but thought it was ok. After that he texted me how amazing i am and kept asking when we would meet again. We met again a few days later, and he constantly wanted to kiss me at any chance along our walking route. I started to think it’s a bit too much (mind you, i am a very affectionate person), especially when he started to thrust his tongue down to my throat!

Each day he texted me to say how beautiful i am. When he said “you are breathtakingly beautiful” was when I thought “Ok, this is a bit too much”. So he planned the third date with walk and brunch, and i guess more time to smooch after brunch. We walked along the seawall in Vancouver, and again he would take every effing chance to kiss me along the way. After brunch, I said “I am tired and I want to go home”. He was disappointed, but obliged. But our date didn’t end their to my dismay! He jumped on the skytrain to ride with me for a few stops, and asked if I would like to get off a station to say “proper goodbye” to him. I asked what “proper goodbye” entailed. He said “like 15 minutes of kissing”. I said “no”. 
So he decided to ride the skytrain all the way with me and then he would return. And of course, he spent that 30 minutes on skytrain trying to kiss me. I kept looking away most of the time or pushing him away a number of times when he tried to kiss me. Whenever he got a chance to kiss me, he would do it like he was devouring my face and kept thrusting his tongue down to my throat! I never felt so grossed kissing a guy before, and i looked at him for the last time and thought to myself, “shit, I deserve better than this”.

The next day i called him and tried to be as graceful as I could telling him that I didn’t want to see him anymore. He took it as graceful as he could... But man, that was gross!","My three dates with an IT nerd I’ve gone through many Tinder dates with a number of cute and educated guys, because i only agreed to meet someone with at least a college degree.

My weird Tinder Experiences,"So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed. So i guess I live like I got nothing to lose half the time, but this doesn't excuse me accepting these weird behaviors and dismissing the red flags. 

First story here that I can remember in detail is I was in my early 20s im female and wanted to start looking on apps with people that were in my area instead of just having long distance online relationships from games, I was chatting with a few people but no luck   for awhile; I got someone interested and we talked for a few weeks then I decided it was okay to meet them at their apartment which probably was not a good idea, anyways got to his apartment and I walked in and noticed the bad cat odor, it was like be never cleans out his cats litter box and i just really was feeling bad for his cat the entire time I was there. He had a small apartment and i had to sit on his bed cause he didn't really have anything else; we chatted a bit and we were trying to find something to watch; and you know when you have to pass gas and you hold it in and it gets loud? Yea that was happening to me at this time, and yea it did get loud and I got embarrassed.. but this guy's reaction was the worst; any normal person might have ignored it or just laughed at me... but he kicked me out and got mad at me, told me I turned him off that I should have somehow walked into the bathroom and did it there... I told him to his face he was rude and I dodged a bullet. I blocked him on my way home; though he was trying to apologize after throwing me out lol... 

This second story; I talked to this one guy that was going to college in my town; we met up after 2 weeks of message; at a diner after my job for like a brunch; i work nights so crazy schedules. I got there and recognized him; we got a table together and sat down. I was looking over the menu; note: I was over weight at the time and I still am to this day; but I was 100lbs heavier at this time.. i was on a weight loss journey but didn't tell this guy, i was just calorie counting so I was gonna have a salad or something small. So i ordered with the waitress when she asked and he ordered then he asked me; is that all you gonna order ? ""I don't believe you just eat that small meal; you must eat more than that"" and the entire time he was trying to force me into eating junk or more than what I wanted... and making me feel bad for being overweight, the last straw was when he pulled out a photo on his Google images of this fit woman with abs and said his gf has to look like that.... lol I didn't hangout with this guy after this date. 

This 3rd story this guy and me talked for 3 weeks online I showed him alot of pictures and then he asked me for body pictures like me standing in a mirror; which yea j sent those also cause people ask for that sometimes and i did keep a few on my profile but I guess i thought he wanted just ones that were taken recently. Anyways he worked as a carnival operator and the fair was in town and I was gonna meet him on his break; so we messaged and everything and then i waited for him in a seating area for dining i waited for awhile and then got a message from him saying; he saw me but could not approach me cause I was not his type anyways; I was apparently not skinny enough when clearly he had a very good idea of what I looked like. I just went home.

Honestly this last one; I kind of stopped matching with people and deleted the application after this one. I decided to meet this guy at a restaurant and we had decent time and good conversation; he kept saying I was way out of his league or too pretty like he didn't deserve to be on a date with me which I thought was weird. We did end up going to his house the second date and i met him there... now idk why he thought this was okay but when I walked in there... there was photos all over the walls and decor of him and his recent wife; i guess they were separated. She left him for some black guy that was what I gathered from the story. He was seeing some therapist about this, and I clearly made it up in my mind im not gonna continue cause this is just way too much  baggage. He should have at least taken down all that stuff; idk the time his ex left but to me it felt like he was not over her and it was like she recently left as how the place was decorated. I hope he did eventually get better or get over her at least.","My weird Tinder Experiences So any reasonable person probably would not put up with these situations but you know I literally live like my life is gonna end when I go to bed.

My nightmare date,"So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here. 

Sorry about my English, I’m brazilian. 

Let’s go to the story. Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a really bad place mentally. I was on tinder trying to find someone to fill my lonely days. I just moved to a new city after a lot of trauma and was struggling a lot to meet new people. So whenever someone showed interest in going out, I would. Even if I didn’t like that person and we didn’t have anything in common. 

I am female and was 20 that time. I left home cause my mom was addict to alcohol and I was really afraid of becoming her, so I didn’t drink. But I was such a stoner. 

So this guy was definitely not my type, but we liked the same movies and books. He wasn’t super talkative but we managed to talk. We lived really close and he invited me to get a drink near by. I told him about my mom and why I didn’t drink, so I invited him to go to a park and smoke. 

I was waiting for him on that park, rolling a joint when I see him coming with 4 bottles of beer. He was tripping over his own feet and looked so intoxicated. I’ve got a bad feeling right away. He sat on my side and put his hand on my tight before even saying anything. I was young and dumb and didn’t feel comfortable telling him to not touch me, so I just smiled uncomfortable and said hi. 

He showed the bottles and asked if I wanted to drink. I told him no and explained why alcohol wasn’t appealing for me, but I didn’t mind if he wanted to drink. Honestly I wanted to go away as soon as possible, but didn’t want to be rude. 

We talked a little. I was putting so much effort to keep that conversation cause all he wanted to talk about was booze and parties. I was trying to get to know him, asking about his hobbies, what he liked to do, what was he studying. He would come closer and closer to me, letting his hands all over my body, my hair, my face. I could smell the booze coming from him. I was trying to get away without making him mad. 

So he leans for a kiss but before his stinky mouth could reach my lips, he moves his head to my lap and THROWS UP. And he throws up a lot. On me. I was in shock. I didn’t move, I just watched that catastrophe. When he finishes it, he looks at me and try to kiss me. HELL NO. 

I finally get up and told him I was going home. He offered to walk me home but I declined. 

I got home, took a long shower while contemplating my existence and why I was going through those meaningless bad dates. As I lay down on my bed and take my phone, the guy had sent me lots of dick pics from every possible angle. I blocked him but I always bumped on him on the supermarket and pretended I didn’t know him. 

So please, tell me your nightmare dates. lol","My nightmare date So I found this sub today and devoured a lot of stories that made me remember some of mine. All my friends says that I’m a bad-date magnet so I thought it would be fun to share some of my experiences here.

I did something... and got my karma,"I love my spouse but I am living in a sexless marriage.   I'm 52 and feel great.

Please don't judge.  Went on tinder one time.  Met guy next day. 36. Gorgeous. 6 4.

I had told him from the beginning if he didn't like what he sees...he did...  but we could make it a one time deal, that's cool too.  He said He will never text me first because of my sitch. I'm like, ok. Perfect.  He said he wanted to see me again etc.

Then next day...blocked me on phone.   So I sent him a text saying that it hurt and it never once occurred to me that he would ghost me. I. Mean. Never. Then blocked him.

I'm delusional I know. I mean this man was gorgeous.   Movie star good looks.

I did everything wrong ,  texted next day,  didn't get naked.  But we were on fire. I mean passion and I know passion.  

So basically, _______ was great for me....Ok for him but not enough to see me again.

My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news,"I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy. 

I went on a couple of dates with this one dude, he was alright but it just fizzled out. A few months after our last date I was randomly watching Good Morning America, and there was a segment on a man who took YEARS to make a proposal video for his long-term girlfriend in multiple countries to that ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" song. My mouth dropped. 

Would have been a sweet story had I not known he was on a date with me (and who knows who else) just a few months prior. Maybe they were on a break? 😅","My best Tinder story - saw a Tinder date on the news I have recently been haunted by a Tinder match, I deleted my profile 5 years ago, but ... it got me thinking about my oddest Tinder dates and I feel like this is one Reddit would most enjoy.

Tinder Confessional Pt. 1," **I hesitated, momentarily, my finger lingering over the image on Tinder. She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening.

She was easy on the eyes, for the most part, but listed herself as “Thiccc” with three C’s. For a fleeting moment I considered swiping left and eliminating forever the potential that she may or may not be capable of concocting. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself as I swiped right with a grand flourish. To my surprise, we matched immediately and the games began. I fired off the standard “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and prepared to hear nothing back. Almost immediately, however, she responded with “Great! Thanks for asking. How is your?” In this moment I had a decision to make. The eagerness combined with swiftness of the reply let me know she was a goer, but was she someone I wanted to go with? As is more often the case than not, I succumbed to the lust in my heart and replied again. After no more than 6 message exchanges, we had planned to meet later that evening.

A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

Tinder Confessional," **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts. As I listlessly browsed Netflix, I felt the urge growing. The sickness I so dutifully kept under wraps was seeking to make an emergence. I sighed heavily as I reached for my phone and unlocked it with the thumbprint. I barely glanced at the screen and I slid the screen right, clicked a cluster of apps, slid those to the left, and opened Tinder. I blindly swiped right a handful of times before I decided to focus on the screen. As I came across a redhead with a sporty bob, I thought to myself she seems like she would be a good time. As my thumb moved right across the screen, the coveted “It’s A Match” graphic appeared and the sickness took hold. I messaged the woman a casually non-threatening “How is your Wednesday treating you?” and returned to swiping right on the masses. Perhaps 15 minutes later, she replied with a friendly “Heyy! It’s going well \*insert smiling emoji\* How are you?” I paused before replying again, sensing the propensity for this scenario to go either way. “I’m doing well, just chilling kinda bored at the moment,” I messaged, gritting my teeth in angst, hoping my message did not communicate a message of thirst or lust. My misgivings were soon assuaged as she responded quickly “Well I’m a little bored myself. Maybe we could find something to do together?”**  [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2019/7/9/these-are-my-tinder-confessions-pt-4)","Tinder Confessional  **Here I was, another lonely Wednesday evening alone with the bong and my thoughts.

Advice needed: He (26m) updated his Tinder pics while talking to me (24f) for a month,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. Been talking to this Tinder guy for a month now. We talk all day, everyday about several topics. He sends me good morning texts everyday. After the first week of talking, I disabled my Tinder profile from showing on the card stacks because I didn't want to keep on getting matches and keeping conversations while talking to him. What happens is that I went back on Tinder last night to check something on one of our first conversations, because we were talking about something related to that and I noticed he updated his Tinder pictures. Now I feel stupid not knowing if I'm just killing his boredom or what. He is a really nice guy and did mention once that he feels like an ass not replying to people's texts.

PS: not going on a date anytime soon because of lockdown!

What do y'all think? Just need some clarity.

Worst first experience,"I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona. Then we finally decided to meet and for the next month we met and made out a lot. It was always fun and we used to talk alot and loved spending time with each other. He would always make plans ahead and ask to meet at least twice a week. Things escalated pretty quickly and he asked me out. I said yes and after that he suggested a staycation since we couldn't go anywhere else for the weekend or didn't have much privacy. He booked the hotel for a day and we had sex thrice in 6 hours. We had a good time and we enjoyed talking to each other too and spending time. But then after this, whenever we made plans to meet one thing or the other came up. He had warned me that his work will get crazy but I didnt know that it would be so crazy that we wouldn't meet or talk much for 2 weeks. Then I finally asked him why he wasn't meeting and that we shouldve met especially after that day when we had sex for the first time but he said he's been thinking that he might not be ready for a serious relationship and that he has lost that part of him that allowed him to fall fast and hard for someone. 
It all sounds bull to me. Either he was just in it for the sex but why would he just have sex one time if he wanted to sex only? Or he just really got busy and didnt know how to handle a relationship and work together.  Idk I'm so confused but god, im never trusting tinder again","Worst first experience I met a guy through tinder and it was my first time using the app. For the first month we talked and video called a lot but didn't meet because of corona.

LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING ME,"This guy was messaging me for a few days trying to hookup. I was always working or unavailable but finally agreed to meet up at my house around 11 pm (def just a hookup).

I‘m fairly new to tinder and maybe just overthinking things but anywayy..

So i(f20) matched this guy (m22) on tinder and the first time we met was last week. Everything was good, we have lots of stuff in common and literally the same taste in music. All in all we‘ve seen eachother 4 times and once i stayed the night at his place. Imo it seems all right but yesterday i went to tinder to check out his profile and during my lil research i saw that he changed his bio and added a new pic..

Soo is it normal to just continue using tinder although you’re currently getting to know someone??","Do you still use tinder after you started hanging out with someone on tinder? He friends

Why wasn’t he hard?,"So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

I matched with this guy like a month ago because he was passing through my city, he lives in a different state. I had just missed him, so I forgot about it. Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me? 

What could cause this for a guy? Was he nervous? -_- help","Why wasn’t he hard? So I had my first tinder hookup the other night, and I have some questions. I’d like to hear a guys perspective on this to be honest.

Then a week ago he messaged me, telling me he was coming back through on his way home. So we made plans. Mind you, me and this guy barely messaged, and when we did it was normal conversations. He never gave me any inkling that he wanted to have sex. Never even sent a winky face. Nothing. 

So fast forward to us hanging out, this guy was really shy, I could tell he was kind of nervous. And I already had this vibe that he wasn’t going to want to have sex, which is fine. I respect that. I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, especially since we never talked about it prior. Anyways we started making out, and after about 10 mins of that, I went to put my hand down on his pants to hint that I wanted him to take them off, and he wasn’t hard. 

And then I asked him to take off his pants, and I could see, it wasn’t hard. I gave him a blowjob, and he enjoyed it. At least I think he did because he finished very quickly. And then proceeded to make out with me right after he finished. 

And after a little bit more of that, he went down on me for a while, which was nice.

My question is, why wasn’t he hard? Because all I can think is wow, I must be fucking ugly. But then I’m like ...if I’m ugly why did he finish so fast? Or why didn’t he leave right after I finished giving him head? Why did he go down on me?

How to Get Laid on Tinder - The Ultimate Guide,"Hey guys, I recently wrote what I reckon is the most comprehensive post on the net on improving your looks &amp; getting laid/finding a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc, **written for men.**. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, making yourself more attractive, taking killer photos, getting matches on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and building a friends-with-benefits or full-on relationship. It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid/find a girlfriend on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're not looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly improving your looks. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/piercings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

It then goes on to cover every aspect of taking photos, including:

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

The guide then goes on to tell you exactly what to text girls, how to set up dates where you both have a tonne of fun, inviting her back to your place, how to have mind-blowing sex and even how to build a relationship.

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post (especially since I can't post pics here, and the article is heavily reliant on pics to give more information). Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?,"SOOOO, I've been reluctant to actually post about my unique tinder experience, simply because I feel like an idiot to even talk about it 2 months later.

I've downloaded and deleted tinder several times since like 2015...during this whole lockdown in the east coast, I was craving some interaction so I decided to download Tinder. Some of them were dubs, most of the conversations would die out. There was one person however, that I instantly clicked with. We never met in person because lockdown restrictions stopped us from meeting up (transportation was heavily restricted and everything was closed ).

He was older, and was raised in the former USSR (i'll tell you why i mentioned this later) I'm F (26) he was 30...or so he stated...i don't even know anymore. He asked that we Facetime, I gave him my number and he immediately decided to FT me...mind you, I was a mess but he said he didn't mind and that eventually he would have to see me in my true colors. We actually joked around and just clicked even more instantly. It then became constant texting, calls and facetime sessions, it all became too real, too quickly. He told me in 4 days that he was looking for something real, that he didn't want someone to just hook up with, and he was pretty adamant about it as well. Mind you, I was still blinded by the charm that he had..I agreed with him as well but that was honestly the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. That same day, he sent me screenshots of spam texts, stating that some girl he previously spoke to before used his # to send spam messages because he cut her off due to various reasons (red flag much?) Of course, with my altruistic self, I told him to remain calm and to just block the number. 

During the span of only 2 weeks (felt like more than a month), we acted like a couple. We would play this mobile game together, talk like a couple, argued like a damn couple, but I started noticing very controlling behavior from his part. He would throw tantrums and throw small degrading insults towards me whenever I would hang out with my friends. At one point, he would say that he's only dated ""dolls"" and that I was a ""tomboy"" (it was lockdown, so why the hell would i get dressed up for a facetime call?!), that if i truly wanted to see him, i would've gone to see him and meet him up out of nowhere. One time, he told me that he supported Trump and proceeded to say pretty racist things (I'm Latina) but that he didn't mean it towards me (lol yeah right).  I told my best guy friend about it and he told me that he seemed like the guy who would SNAP out of nowhere....(turned out he was right). One day, My friends decided to take a quick trip down the beach and I decided to tell him about it cause why the hell not? He instantly became distant...and very snarky....he called me and we spoke for a bit...but then there was straight silence for 3 hours until he decided to curse me and my friends out via text message....once i got home, I called him and we spoke...he said he was ""testing me"" to see how i would react....I wish I wasn't so naive at that time and didn't give him the benefit of doubt but I did.

I shit you not, 3 days later we were facetiming and we were talking about random shit, he legit brought up how back home in Uzbekistan how women would be put in their place if they did something their husband or boyfriends didn't like and how in the USA women have too much power (WHAT?!) I stayed silent and asked him if he condoned domestic violence and he stayed quiet....that already left a bad taste in my mouth because I liked the guy so much and I was starting to see his true colors....he also brought up how he was in a bad path in his life, getting into fights with strangers, getting arrested, drugs etc. I was there to give a shoulder to lean on (virtually) and we then started playing the game we would play with together. I got booted out from the team by his teammates (they spoke in their language so i didn't understand jack shit) and i proceeded to play my own game. I get a text message later saying how I do perfectly well without him and proceeded to call me a ""whore"" and a whole bunch of other unnecessary shit just because i played with other guys (they were kids probably like 8-12 yr olds)......he said he didn't see himself with me due to different morals and mentality, so i decided to cut him off. FAST FORWARD to this month, I have my own selling profile on a selling platform, I saw that a week after our fall off, he commented on one of my listings once again racial slurs and how he's glad he never met me. i commented back wishing him to have a good life and all that jazz. We eventually started communicating again..but all he did was try to blame me for leaving him and forgetting about him (hell no i didn't forget him because despite his horrible temper and mouth, i still liked his good side) he apologized but meanwhile trying to put the blame on me, saying he won't forgive me for that but yet...said to never leave him again because he truly liked me and that he gets extremely jealous because I was so different from the other girls he's dated or spoken to....long story short, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and wished him to find true happiness that i wouldn't take him back...all he replied back was ""all the best!"" and since then I haven't heard anything from him...yet....I felt like i started to fall for him but at the same time, I wonder how toxic and unhealthy this would've been if it continued...I ever wonder if he will realize that the reason why I ""walked"" away was because of his horrible insults and because he never truly apologized for his actions...it sucks because I truly saw good in him...even saw a future with him in a span of 2 weeks of just virtual communication...","Fell for someone in just 2 weeks..or maybe not ?

My Tinder Sex/Scam Story - Philippine Edition,"Hey How's it going guys?

I just want to share to you about my experience today regarding Tinder. I also hope that you can learn something from this experience and have your opinions about this matter.

So I just met this girl(or i dunno what she is) let's just call her M. So basically, I met M in tinder last night. She has a very charming photo and I guess in pictures she's a woman. So we matched and I started to chat her by giving her a friendly Hi and she respond. We chatted for couple of hours and she invited me to chat in Snap chat. I'm fine with chatting snap chat and I'm quite familiar to the app and she started to invite me to hangout which is cool for me. We began chatting for couple of hours and she started seducing me with her hot ass photos and I also send mine(Don't do it kids). I even sent her a video of mine jerking off with a lot of jizz on it. And she also sent me couple of her videos. I'm not gonna lie she has the most amazing body I've ever seen. That's one of the reasons why asked her multiple times if she is a transgender. So after all the dumb things I've done she asked me to have sex with her on Saturday on a nice hotel in Ayala Makati. The next morning, she sent me a photo about a booking of the Hotel which is a 5 star hotel in Makati with a cost of 15000 PHP(She booked it and have it covered). Like what the hell!? Hanggang sogo lang ako. Based demands, she don't like a cheap hotel room for both of use and I'm good with that.

So here is the craziest part. She asked for assurance that I will go on that hotel room. Because of her past encounters of being ditched I'm the lucky guy that she began saving nude pics. (I fucked this up i sent my original username in snapchat). She began threatening me on what assurance I can give for meeting and having sex with her. I felt miserable, I'm not a bad person, I'm even not a ghoster why did I deserve this?

So what I did to make this things up since she already paid for the hotel room I offered to pay for it which upsets her even more. She really wants to have sex with me. She said that I should my money involved with this and promise me that she will return it once we meet and fuck. I felt like this is kind of Sextortion. I dunno what to feel, she already payed for the hotel room and I also want to get laid but not this one. I also don't know this point if she;s doing it because she is a transgender. Believe me guys, she really looked like a legitimate female and I dunno the difference between a transgender body to a legit female body. I end up paying it doubled and she sent me a video deleting my nudes on her phone, completely. At of this point were still contacting each other. I really hope she's not a transgender. What are you thoughts on this guys?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Not really a good writer. This is the only way i can explain my thoughts.

Tinder needs to add filter features,"I wish this app would add features to filter profiles. Grindr has features that allow people to filter by ""tribe"" and apps like meet me have all kinds of tags like ""stoner or gamer or sporty ect."" and will show you people with similar profile tags. I feel like tinder would be a much more effective app if it would add some sort features like this so people could narrow down their search to seeing profiles closer to their type vs. having swipe left through all the people you aren't interested in.","Tinder needs to add filter features I wish this app would add features to filter profiles.

Need help,"Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other. So yesterday I reinstalled tinder to just see if she was active on the app or not but her profile is gone from my messages on there. Now I know if you block or unmatch with someone on there it will remove you from the persons messages and vise versa, but if you disable your profile would it still show their profile in your messages or does it disappear ? Other than that she’s a very beautiful girl and seems genuine but just thought I’d ask to see if anyone knew how tinder works.","Need help Hey, my name is Lou and long story short I met a girl on tinder and we talked on there for a while and recently asked for her number so we’ve been texting/calling and I recently asked if we should delete tinder since her and I are vibing with each other.

I matched with my next door neighbor,"So last night I matched with my next door neighbor. I've never met her in person, but I have seen her around the house and she has also seen me pottering about. She lives with two other girls in the house opposite me. It makes me wonder if she actually knows that I'm her neighbor. How should I approach this? What would be a great opening line?","I matched with my next door neighbor So last night I matched with my next door neighbor.

Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed,"So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks. Thing is he is deployed here and in the army. He lives a good couple hours away from me and he told me that since coming to my country he has problems with his bank account and no access to it. This means that if I come to see him I basically have to pay for renting a car, gas , a hotel and whatever else. Not to mention an 11h  round trip. I thought it was kind of weird that he doesn't have any access to that and the trip for me is pretty damn expensive especially cause im making less money due to the corona. But whatever
 I actually started really liking him. So j Just went ahead and visited him. Tbh it was amazing and I'm still starstruck. Everything about him was amazing and that was the best sex ever.

But now I'm back.home and technically dying to see him again but I know I can't afford another trip over there and in all honesty kind of shady he doesn't have anyway to regain access to his money so should I just drop him?
Any ideas? I'd have the idea I'm being played by him.","Feel for a guy but I.might be getting scammed So I met this guy on a dating app. Somehow we clicked and chatted for like a few weeks.

My worst tinder date,"I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder. Anyway, met this guy who went to my school and we texted for a while. He was a funny and we texted all day for a couple days and we end up making plans to hang. My friend was having a get together one night and I figured I'd invite him to make things less creepy. 

So I meet the guy in the lobby and he looks NOTHING like his photos and honestly smelled like wet dog. Mind you, he was in a class with two of my friends who both said he was a decent guy. I'm a very polite person so despite my disappoint I push myself to get through the night. We walk through the door and my friends are immediately entertained as they clearly agreed he was unattractive. The guy is super awkward, wasn't actually funny irl and ultimately got wasted and started very openly flirting with me, insisting I sit on his lap, kiss him, etc. Eventually, I tell him I'm going to my dorm for the night and therefore he should leave as well because my friends were clearly uncomfortable. He insists on finishing his drink which he is drinking incredibly slow. When we leave, aggressively attempts to pull my head in for a kiss which is when I noped so fast and headed the opposite side of the building. He texted me the next day and I blocked him. Luckily never saw him again and I now refuse to meet up with anyone on tinder before we FaceTime atleast once.","My worst tinder date I joined tinder as a college freshman and went to a fairly small school where everyone knew each other so I ventured into the small city via tinder.

I was permanently banned for refusing a second date..,"This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me.. 

SO. I matched with this guy FOREVER ago. Maybe two years ago-ish?? We texted for a bit then eventually went on a date. He was literally the creepiest person I'd ever met. It was his idea to go on a skating date but he didn't bring skates to the outdoor rink (where you can't rent them).. and asked me to call my friends to see who would let him borrow skates. ALSO, He told me he hadn't skated in roughly ten years. AGAIN, this date was his idea, he picked the location and everything. To add insult to injury, when we got to the Ice rink, he locked the car door as I reached for the handle, put his hand on my knee and said ""maybe we should take the time to get to know eachother first."" By this point, I had texted my friends and aksed them to come pick me up ASAP and they could not have arrived at a better time. Needless to say, I did not have a good time. 
But he obviously felt different because he kept asking me on a second date. So I didn't lead him on or lie but I wasn't rude about it either. I just said I had a nice time, but that I wasn't interested in a second date, I hope there's no hurt feelings.. etc etc. I've been rejected many times, I know it sucks so I knew he likely wouldn't take it well..  but I had no idea he'd block my number then DM me on tinder and inform me he was going to report my profile. Then of course he proceeded to do exactly that. Later that week my tinder account was banned and I got an email saying I violated the terms of service and agreement policy and was prohibited from using my account. I tried making different accounts with different emails &amp; numbers, but was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Moral of the story? I guess be very picky about who you meet off the internet and make sure to clarify your date plans..","I was permanently banned for refusing a second date.. This isn't so much a ""horror"" story as it is just absolutely pathetic and unfortunate for me..

Tinder Hook Up: Close Call: Murder," So, on the night of Sunday, May 24 I decided I had been cooped up long enough (*Thanks Covid*) I wanted to explore Tinder for a night of fun.

One of the guys I had been talking to over the last month was online so I hit him up, he is 32yo &amp; has a 8yo daughter so I figured it was a safe bet. It was about 2-3 AM. He is staying down the street from me less than a mile according to Tinder. He agrees to meet up, I am excited to meet him &amp; all went well.

The next morning he leaves, I hope on my phone to find a news headline for the murder of Ashlyn Black.

She was only 25 years old, murdered by Ethan Hunsaker after meeting for drinks &amp; hooked up. They met on Tinder the same night I met my hook up. I am only a year older than Ashlyn &amp; live less than an 1/2 an hour away... I felt sick.

*""...Hunsaker woke up and began to choke the victim ""for as hard as he could for one minute,"" he described to officers. She attempted to fight off Hunsaker – and in the process – scuffed up Hunsaker's arms, neck and shoulder areas.*

*Arrest documents state Hunsaker then stood up and retrieved a ""spring assisted pocket knife that had about four inch blade"" from the kitchen. He told investigators he then kneeled over the victim and stabbed her between five to ten times in the chest, sides and back.*

*Hunsaker watched the victim bleed out for approximately 10 minutes before calling 911 to turn himself in. During the phone call, he told dispatch that he ""did not know"" the victim and that he would like officers to kill him upon arrival. He described to dispatch he had weapons and what knife he used to stab her. ...""*

Normally, I know my partners for awhile before things get to a more intimate level. My hookup I knew very little about. Today, I decided I should dig for information on my new guy. Come to find out he was arrested &amp; charged with disorderly conduct with a protection-from-abuse order 13 years ago for harassment after a breakup with Paul Sorvino's daughter \[*He was 21yo &amp; she was 36 yo*\].

Is this guy creepy or nah?,"After I originally swiped right on this one dude, I realized I wasn’t that attracted to him, so I stopped replying to him after a couple of messages. Well, he found me on Instagram and started messaging me on there after I tried ghosting him. A part of me thought that may be a little weird, but I figured I should maybe try talking to him a little. He then asked for my snap which I gave to him. However, I also don’t keep up with any of my social media as often as I should. He added me as a friend, but I didn’t immediately add him back because I got sidetracked and busy with other things. Well, a couple hours later he messaged me on insta all freaked out asking if he did something wrong and why I blocked him on Snapchat. I still hadn’t added him or been on my snapchat, so I was like wtf?? I finally added him back after he those messages and asked him why he thought I blocked him which I guess he had immediately sent me a snap which showed as pending cause obviously I hadn’t added him back yet. So I’ve snapped him a few times since yesterday and idk the dude’s just a little weird. I’ve also recently graduated college and have moved back home with my parents to save a bit of money. I still have to move out of my apartment that’s near my college which is about a 3 hour drive. He asked me to do something this weekend, but I’m supposed to go up there to finish moving out. He then offered to help me move and that he loves my college town which makes sense cause it’s pretty touristy with lottts to do. I asked him if he was already planning on going there this weekend, and he said no but he’s always willing to go there. Basically, he’s offering to travel 3 hours to go to a place to help me move and chill and stuff. I also want to say that this has happened over the period of a few days and we haven’t even met in person yet, so the fact that he’s willing to travel 3 hours and is so clingy and persistent is really turning me off. Am I justified in seeing the red flags?  Is this dude just creepy? Should I just block and ghost? 😅","Is this guy creepy or nah?

Matching people but no message!,"I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this. 

After superliking someone and matching with them on tinder, the person I have superliked then doesn’t reply to my message.

The reason this strikes me as odd is due to the fact that it is a super like and not a normal like so they know they will match with me if they like me and should be expecting a message.
Obviously this isn’t a common thing due to the limit on super likes but I just find it quite bizarre.

Is this a common occurrence for other people or is it because the message I’m sending just isn’t interesting? I don’t just open with a ‘hey’ so I don’t know what else to do, it can be quite demoralising at times.","Matching people but no message! I was just hoping to get other people’s perspective on this.

What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones.,"As title mentions. 

I’ll kick us off: 

For reference as stupid as it is, I was looking for something serious but didn’t want to complicate my life by bringing in certain situations... 

1. Sweet guy, texted loads with over the phone before meet-up. Upon meet-up it appears guy had forgotten to mention he was legally deaf and our meet-up had to continue conversation-wise halfway through a speech-to-text app that had issues with my accent and for the latter part over WhatsApp. I don’t think that was gonna work out... 

2. Okay guy. Didn’t seem to be my type but willing to give it a chance. Upon meet-up he was every bit as much the ‘tough guy turned good’ as I had assumed he’d be. Very insistent on helping me and being there for me even after a first short date, eerily so: He bought me potting soil after he saw I was working on a plant and had ran out. 
I never asked for this. 
Gave him another two dates then he brings out why he’s so insisting: he’s living with a woman he hates. He ‘tried to move away from her but it was too expensive’ and ‘sleeps on the couch’.  She has his surname but ‘they aren’t married’. He has a kid with her he still wants to support. He insists that the kid nor the woman would ever trouble me or make my life more difficult. Despite referencing multiple times that the mom is legit crazy. 
Now he’s calling all his mates/family and sending them pictures of his ‘new girlfriend’ despite my wishes of this to stop both as pictures and ‘relationship’ as there never was one... we never even held hands...

3. Okay guy. Texted a lot over the app and found some cornerstones so we got on a first date. We sit out in a park and he’s having whiskey and I’m having soda. 
Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.","What’s your top 3(or more) of weirdest Tinder Encounters? Here’s my 3 top ones. As title mentions.

Halfway through I get a text from a male friend. He sees the name and asks if it’s family. I say ‘no’ and explain he’s a good friend. 
He goes off on a shouty tangent that leaves me shaking that he’s not willing to share me with anyone and that we’re meant for each other and I played with his feelings. Bullet dodged. I ghost him. He video calls me a few days later just to call me a lowly whore and flips me off. A month later he starts texting me like nothing happened and asks how I’m doing. He got blocked. He texts me on his (I assume) worknumber to tell me to ‘fuck off.’ Number blocked as well.",1
Tinder date has girlfriend in different country,"Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex. He is very nice and romantic treating me like I'm his only girlfriend. I'm curious of him so I look at his Instagram and there's something suspicious about him and a particular girl that obviously lives in a country (her photos are tagged in different country and all her photo caption is written in a foreign language) and it seems she is his girlfriend she comments about his looks and he does the same to her. I'm very heartbroken and confused. I have feelings for this guy and have fallen madly in love with him. It makes me wonder how people can form a relationship with someone on the other side of the world and think it's ok and can work out. I want to continue seeing him and at the same time I can't get out of my head what a cheating scumbag he is doing this to this girlfriend. Why does a guy feel the need to use Tinder if there already in a relationship? Should I stay, leave, tell his girlfriend? Opinions?","Tinder date has girlfriend in different country Shortly after I met this guy on Tinder we exchange numbers, and we hang out and have sex.
