    "1. Spotify uses its popularity parameter in order to rank songs, albums, and artists. This \"popularity\" metric is based on how often users stream songs from Spotify. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. But how does this popularity metric by song-streaming compare with other metrics for popularity? This metric only shows how popular very recent artists are in general (not popularity according to genre or popularity by song/lyrical content). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. As a result, historically VERY popular classic songs (by Earth, Wind, & Fire, The Beatles, and other \"classic groups\") are overlooked. Additionally, artists who are VERY popular in their genre become ignored due to people from higher popularity genres like \"pop.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "4. We need a new metric for popularity. In fact, we need ideally ideas for more than one new popularity metric and how to collect those metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we predict a song's popularity by stream count accurately using Regression Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can we predict whether a song is popular by stream count using Classification Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What can we say about a song's popularity based on aspects of the music itself: like danceability, energy, and acousticness? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What can we say about a song’s popularity based on the content of an artist's lyrics--the verbal connotations and vibe of the poetry? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do each of these factors influence our ability to predict the popularity of an artist or song?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, when using Regression modeling, Classification modeling, and NLP Clustering to predict the popularity of a musical artist, how can evaluate whether or not to trust Spotify's ranking of popularity? \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What other metrics of popularity should we define and recommend that Spotify and other top streaming sites adopt? What is our reasoning?"

    "Spotify Song Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First (for Song Attributes), I scrape ten different playlists off of Spotify full of exactly 699 \"Rising\" songs from 2020. I clean the data, removing NAN values and duplicates for the songs. Spotify has a built in popularity function based on number of streams. This is ordered_playlist. Then, I import a dataframe of roughly 232,000 songs from 2018-2020 made by a prominent Kaggle musical data scientist, Zaheen Hamidani, to the small dataset. I clean this data, dropping NAN values and duplicates. Next, I concatenate this songlist to ordered_songlist. At last, I name this large dataframe of roughly 150,000 songs as giant_ordered_playlist.\n",
    "2. Second, I build a wide variety of Regression Models that try to accurately predict a song's \"stream-popularity\" based off of the song's musical attributes (like energy, valence, modality, time signature, and other characteristics). I will also use many different Classification Models to measure whether we can predict that a song is popular (above 75% popularity on a scale of 0 to 100) based off of these same song attributes. \n",
    "3. Finally, I interpret the differences between the stream-based popularity metric and this song-attribute-based popularity metric, generating reasons for incongruities and making conclusions about the effectiveness of our popularity metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genius Lyric Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. First (for Lyric Attributes), I use the shorter list of playlist songs (just 700 songs from ordered_playlist) from Spotify as a basis for which lyrics to scrape. I scrape the lyrics for each of these songs off of Genius' lyric library.\n",
    "4. Second, I use sentiment analysis and NLP (CountVectorizer) to perform EDA on the most common words/sentiments for each song.\n",
    "5. Finally, I try to evaluate whether there is a correlation between most common words and song sentiment with its popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lyric Clustering Processing (Completed Stretch Goal)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. First (for Lyrics), I use Spacey to convert the lyrics of the 300 most common words in each song of ordered_playlist into vectors. These word vectors are arranged by their similarity to one another on a large coordinate plane. \n",
    "7. Finally, I try to evaluate whether there is a correlation between a group of lyrics' content and their artist's stream-popularity. I conclude that yes, there IS a clear relationship between a song's stream-popularity and lyrical content. Though, for further research, I would like to pursue Hypothesis Testing to be certain of this relationship being a correlation at a statistically significant level."

    "The songs' average loudness is -7 loudness on a scale of -50 to 0 (decibels behave in a different manner, so this is a more appropriate way of modeling them). This is an extremely high score for the songs' loudness, indicating that these recent songs (from 2020) are fairly loud. This makes sense; before the 2000s--music was technologically much more compressed when it was rendered into a digital format. Now that computer systems have grown so much more powerful, reducing less of the overtones and decibels from the music, these songs become less compressed and more loud on average. It is not that kids' rock music is louder than 1970s music was. It is that compression has changed. This evidence comes from analysis by Elena Georgieva of Stanford University Data Scientists.\n",

    "The danceability and energy for both the mean and median of this dataset is a high average of around 55%, indicating that danceability and energy are generally favored in music streamed through spotify from 2017-2020. This makes total sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "Speechiness is, on average, 13% mean and 5% median. With the popularity of rap, this is a bit confusing. However, I reason this lack of speechiness as the fact that \"sung\" music is not recognized as \"speechy\"--only spoken music like rap is considered \"speechy.\" This distinction is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liveness is 21.5% mean and 13% median, which makes lots of sense. Most modern pop songs, even with mostly instrumental and non-electronic musicians like Adele, have some element of digital music like \"synths\" that make this statistic lower than one may expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valence is described by spotify in terms of \"positivity\" versus \"negativity.\" Their API website states \"valence\" as being the following: \"A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\" On average for both mean and median, these songs are slightly pessimistic (45%). \n",

    "\n",
    "Acousticness is 41% for mean and 30% for median, indicating that modern music is less acoustic. This also makes sense with the rise of digital music.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean popularity of this music is 35% and the median is 30%, indicating that most of the data is not in the camp of being \"very popular.\" So, Spotify CAN afford to be selective about which artists it selects. Not EVERYONE can be a pop star; this is proof."
