### Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

#### Problem Statement
Geographically, the United States remains divided by more than just geology. For each state, the participation rate of their high school students in the SAT vs ACT varies wildly. Yet, clear trends and correlations emerge. Why do some states remain loyal to only one test? Moreover, which specific factors influence the popularity of tests? Additionally, how do political and economic factors influence the layout of the test landscape? Finally, what can we suggest to raise participation rates.

#### Executive Summary
The ACT dominates the SAT rate all three years in terms of participation. This results from State-Required Testing, Self-Selection, Economic Inequality, and Political Bias. To increase participation, we recommend that the SAT Board streamline the Fee Waiver Application Process, get rid of SAT Subject Tests, increase State-Required SAT Tests, add Science as its own Subject, and politically insist on the importance of SAT testing.
